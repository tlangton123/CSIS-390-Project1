	<h4> <u> Problem #2: SIMPLIFIED POKER </u> </h4>
	<p> <u> Background Information: </u> Most poker hands use five cards. In simplified four card poker, four cards are used <br>
	for a hand. Four card poker hands are classified as one of the following: a Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four-of-a- <br> 
	Kind, Flush, Straight, Three-of-a-kind, Two-pairs, One-Pair, Nothing.  You will be given four cards from a regulation <br>
	52-card deck of playing cards. Your program will determine if the four cards constitute:</p>
		<p><b>Four-of-a-Kind</b> (all four cards are the same kind) <br>
		<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b> (three cards are the same and one card is different) <br>
		<b>Two-Pairs</b> (two cards are the same kind and the other two cards of the same kind, but different than the first pair) <br>
		<b>One-Pair</b> (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of different kinds)<br>
		or <br>
		<b>No-Mathches</b> (all four cards are of different kinds)<br>
		Note that in simplified poker we are not computing any other type of hand such as flushes or straights.<br><br>

Normally, each card would be designated with a kind and a suit. For this problem, we will be ignoring the suits and <br>
 just designating the kind of each card. The kind will be in the range  [2, 14], with  2 for a Two, 3 for a Three, â€¦ 11 <br>
 for a Jack, 12 for a Queen, 13 for a King, and 14 for an Ace. <br>
Cards will be input from lowest to highest.

		</p>
			<u> Programming Problem:</u> 
			<pre>
			Input: Four integers (in the range 2..14) in ascending order.
				The four integers will be on four separate lines. 
			
			Output:	The type of hand followed by the four cards (integers).

			Example 1:	Input:	7 7 7 7
						Output:	<b>Four-of-a-Kind</b>   7 7 7 7
	
			Example 2:	Input:	3 9 9 9
						Output:	<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b>   3 9 9 9

			Example 3:	Input:	2 4 4 6
						Output:	<b>One-Pair</b>    2 4 4 6
	
			Example 4:	Input:	10 11 12 13
						Output:	<b>No-Matches</b>      10 11 12 13
