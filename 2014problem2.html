	<h4> <u> Problem #2: TIME IS? </u> </h4>
	<p> <u> Background Information: </u> <br>
	If you were asked to “simplify” 200 seconds you would not say, ” 3.3333333” minutes. You would say, “3<br>
	minutes and 20 seconds”.  <br> <br>
	If you were asked to “simplify” 1000000 (one million seconds) you would say, “11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes,<br>
	and 40 seconds”. <br> <br>
	And if you were asked to “simplify” 1000000000 (one billion seconds) you would say, “31 years, 259 days, 1 <br>
	hour, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds”. Once we are asked to simplify a number of seconds greater than 31536000 <br>
	we will assume that a year is exactly 365 days long. <br>

			<p> <u> Programming Problem:</u>
	<pre>	
		Input:  a positive integer N less than 2000000000 representing a number of seconds.
		Output: N seconds “simplified” into years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. You must
		only output the units starting with the greatest unit that has a value greater
		than 0. 

		Example 1:	Input: 		3640
				Output:		1 hours
						0 minutes
						40 seconds

		Example 2: 	Input: 		1000000000
				Output: 	31 years
						259 days
						1 hours
						46 minutes
						40 seconds
