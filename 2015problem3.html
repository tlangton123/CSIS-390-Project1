	<h1>Problem 3 2015</h1>
	<h2>Polygon Labeling</h2>
	<body> <p> <u> Background Information: </u> There are (n – 1)! ways to uniquely label the vertices of an n-gon.If  any labeling <br>
	of an n-gon can be rotated to match a previous labeling, the labeling is not unique.  However, a labeling is unique,<br>
	even if a reflection (or reflection followed by a rotation) of the labeling matches a previous labeling. For example,<br>
	Figures 1 and 2 below are not uniquely labeled but Figures 1 and 3 are uniquely labeled. </p>

The Automated Testing Company needs a program that will input two lists of integers and determine if the second <br>
 is (or is not)  a cycle of the first. If the second is a cycle of the first, then the two would not uniquely label an n- <br>
 gon. Each list will contain between 3 and 20 positive integers. Obviously, if different integers are used for the <br>
 labeling, there is no cycle. The program will output the appropriate message of either CYCLE or NO CYCLE.

			<p> <u> Programming Problem:</u>
			<pre>
			Input:		A pos. integer 3 ≤ n ≤ 20 for the size of the n-gon followed by two labeling lists. 
						Each list will consist of n positive integers. 
			Output:	Either “CYCLE” or “NO CYCLE”.


	Example1:	Input:	3 			Example 2:	Input:	4
			1						1
			2						2
			3						3
			2						4
			1						3
			3	  					4
Output:    NO CYCLE				5
									6
									Output:  NO CYCLE
