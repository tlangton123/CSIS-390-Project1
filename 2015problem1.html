	<h1>Problem 1 2015</h1>
	<h2>Be There, And Be More than Square</h2>
	<body> <p> <u> Background Information: </u> On a standard 8x8 checkerboard you can identify 1,296 unique rectangles. On a 
1x1 checkerboard there is just one rectangle. On a 2x2 checkerboard there are 9 unique rectangles. On a 
3x3 checkerboard there are 36 unique rectangles. On a 4x4 checkerboard there are 100 unique rectangles. 
On a 5x5 checkerboard there are 225 unique rectangles. On a 6x6 checkerboard there are 441 unique 
rectangles. In fact, on an NxN checkerboard there are ((N(N+1))/2)^2rectangles.</p>
