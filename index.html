		<p>Welcome to the <em>hopefully</em> official page of Siena College's 
		29th annual High School Programming contest! Here you can sign up for 
		the contest, view example problems from previous years, and much much more! <br> <br> 
		
		The Siena College Programming Contest is an annual event held by the Siena College Computer Science Department. 
		Local high schools teams come to Siena's campus, usually in March or April, and are given 6-8 problems that they 
		need to solve by using a coded program. The number of teams have been anywhere from eight to 30 teams.</p>
