	<h1>Problem 2 2015</h1>
	<h2>Simplified Poker</h2>
	<body> <p> <u> Background Information: </u> Most poker hands use five cards. In simplified four card poker, four cards are used for a hand. Four card poker hands are classified as one of the following: a Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four-of-a-Kind, Flush, Straight, Three-of-a-kind, Two-pairs, One-Pair, Nothing.  You will be given four cards from a regulation 52-card deck of playing cards. Your program will determine if the four cards constitute:</p>
		<p><b>Four-of-a-Kind</b> (all four cards are the same kind)
		<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b> (three cards are the same and one card is different)
		<b>Two-Pairs</b> (two cards are the same kind and the other two cards of the same kind, but different than the first pair)
		<b>One-Pair</b> (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of different kinds)
		or 
		<b>No-Mathches</b> (all four cards are of different kinds)
		Note that in simplified poker we are not computing any other type of hand such as flushes or straights.

Normally, each card would be designated with a kind and a suit. For this problem, we will be ignoring the suits and just designating the kind of each card. The kind will be in the range  [2, 14], with  2 for a Two, 3 for a Three, â€¦ 11 for a Jack, 12 for a Queen, 13 for a King, and 14 for an Ace.
Cards will be input from lowest to highest.

		</p>
			<p> <u> Programming Problem:</u> Input:		Four integers (in the range 2..14) in ascending order.
The four integers will be on four separate lines. 
	Output:	The type of hand followed by the four cards (integers).

	Example 1:	Input:	7 7 7 7
		Output:	<b>Four-of-a-Kind</b>   7 7 7 7
	
	Example 2:	Input:	3 9 9 9
		Output:	<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b>   3 9 9 9

Example 3:	Input:	2 4 4 6
	Output:	<b>One-Pair</b>    2 4 4 6

Example 4:	Input:	10 11 12 13
Output:	<b>No-Matches</b>      10 11 12 13
